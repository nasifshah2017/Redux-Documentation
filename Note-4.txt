Lecture-81: Wiring Up Redux 

In this lesson we are finally going to code, we are going to set up the basic pieces of a Redux app. We are going to get the structure down and we are slowly going to add piece by piece 

until we get to the end. 


1. In order to wire up a redux/react app, we need react-redux. Specifically, we need the Provider component to be around everything!!


index.js

import React from "react";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "./index.css";

import App from "./App";


// In order to wire up a react/redux app, we need react-redux

// We need the Provider component to be around everything!!

import { Provider } from "react-redux";

// We are not going to render the <App /> anymore, instead we are going to render the Provider component that is coming from react-redux and that is going to go around everything.

// We are going to place it around the <App /> component, 


	ReactDOM.render(

		<Provider>

			<App />

		</Provider>,

		document.getElemenById("root")

	);


// This is how our App is always going to look like at the top-level when you are making Redux. 


We need everything inside the Provider component. Now, as we are using the new module, react-redux, we need to install react-redux from our command line,


terminal coding:

	npm install react-redux


Now, we will run our app and see what we get,


terminal coding:

	npm start


Now, we will see what is running on the browser and we get an error,


Module not found: Can't resolve 'redux' in '/Users/robertbunch/udemy/reactCourse/video-code/redux101/node_modules/react-redux/es/connect' 


So, we cannot use react-redux without also having redux, as they necessarily depend on each other.

So, we will install redux,

Terminal coding:

	npm install redux


Whenever that is done we need to run npm start again, 

Terminal coding:

	npm start


Now, we can see on the browser that we are still getting errors,

TypeError: Cannot read property 'getState' of undefined

So, the browser is fraustratred that it cannot get the State.

TypeError: Cannot read property 'getState' of undefined 

25	- this.previousState = store.getState();


Now, if we look deep into the state we can see that it tried to get State from the Store and there is no Store.

Remember, when looked at React-Redux we saw that the Provider component was in the middle and it connected the Store with React and right now we are trying to render a Provider component

without a Store and that is not okay!!

So, we solved our first problem by importing react-redux, we are still having some errors and that is okay. The second step inorder to solve this problem is that we need to create the redux

store, so the Provider component has a Store. Or you can say that however you want to but Redux does not exist without the Store, because we included Redux


index.js

import React from "react";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "./index.css";

import App from "./App";


// 1. In order to wire up  redux/react app, we need react-redux. We need the Provider Component to be around everything!


import { Provider } from "react-redux";


// 2. We need to create the Redux Store, so that redux exists and the Provider has a Store!!


import { createStore } from "redux";


// Remember where things re coming from, we have the "react-redux" here that is the module or the library from where the Provider component comes from, we have got the Redux module here, 

// that is from where the createStore function comes from. If you see 'redux' as the module you are importing from that means 'react' does not know about this thing and it also means 

// 'react-redux' does not know about this thing. 

// We can also use 'redux' in any other framework or also in native JavaScript. The 'createStore' function is part of 'redux' and now we are going to give the Store to the Provider 

// component but at this point the 'createStore' function has nothing to do with anything, it is just pure redux.


// Now what makes up the 'redux' store? 

// If you remember their 'reducer' functions those return a piece of state but what we need are reducers to populate the Store. 


// The Store by itself is just like a building it is just a building with the word Grocery Store on it. We need the 'reducers' which are going to be the Produce department, the Frozen 

// department, the Meat department and so on.


// All these little individual departments will populate the Store together. 

// So, the Store is just an aggregate of the 'reducers', we need to have atleast one reducer in order to have any Store. 


// 3. reducers to populate the Store

// 3a. We always start with a rootReducer 

// It means we will make one sort of master reducer, you can think of it like a Store Manager that will import all of the other 'reducers'. 


// We will make a new folder and we are going to call it 'reducers'. We are going to name it starting with lowercase 'r' because it is not a component. 

// Inside of this 'reducers' folder we are going to make a new file called 'rootReducer.js'. Now, again it is not a component file, so we name it starting with a lowercase letter.

// A lot of times people call this 'rootReducer.js' as 'index.js' and that it perfectly fine and that is probably more conventional. We are going to call it 'rootReducer.js' to keep us 

// from getting confused because the more 'index.js' we have, usually the quicker the developers are to give up, so we have gotten the 'rootReducer.js' because we are on a learning phase we

// can always rename it to 'index.js' if we wish. 


rootReducer.js

// This is the rootReducer!! It is the Store Manager of all Reducers. 

// It is the manager of the Store. It collects all the departments and gets them to the right place.

// To make a rootReducer we need to: 

// 1. Get a method from redux, called combineReducers

// The method combineReducer will combine each of the individual reducer to one big store. 


import { combineReducers } from "redux";


// 2. Get each individual reducer 

// Now, we need to make each of these individual reducers and import those reducers to this 'rootReducer.js' file.

// We are going to make a new file in the 'reducers' folder with the name "frozenReducer.js". It is like the department containing all frozen food.

// So, think back what are reducers? frozenReducer is a reducer, it has it's name starting with a lower-case letter, it is not a component. 

// A reducer is just a function. 


frozenReducer.js

src/reducers/frozen.js

export default () => {

	return []

}


// So, here we are directly 'export defaulting' an anonymous function but we can also provide a name to the function, it will not make any difference as there is no context here to worry 

// about. For now we are returning an array in the function. This is the simplest possible reducer we have. 


frozenReducer.js

// All reducers have 2 params

// 1. Current State, usually provide a default state

// 2. Info that came from any action 

export default (state = [], action) => {

	return []

}
 

// So, with this function we are passing two arguments 'state' and 'action'. These are the two parameters (arguments), and we initially provide a default state that is because if the state 

// is not assigned to anything then we will assign it to an array. So, instead of just returning an empty array we will return the state,


frozenReducer.js

// All reducers have 2 params

// 1. Current State, usually provide a default state 

// 2. Info that came from any action


export default (state = [], action) => {

	return state; 

} 


// This reducer is totally useless, because it will always return an empty array, but this qualifies as a reducer because it is just a function. This function is written in the ES-6 version

// JavScript but we can re-write it in the Vanilla JavaScript format too, 


export default (state = [], action) => {

	return state;

} 



is equivalent to



function frozenReducer(state = [], action) {

	return state;

} 


export default frozen; 



// We will soon import this frozenReducer.js file in the rootreducer file and that will export this function here, which will provide the state sent in it. We do not need to give this 

// function a name, again you can give it a name, you might end up in situations where we have got lot of different functions in the same file or you are collecting a bunch of like reducers

// in the same file but we have got a small function here so we are exporting it as an anonymous function. 


// Now, we will go back to our rootReducer.js file and there we will import the frozenReducer.js file, 



rootReducer.js

// This is the root reducer! It is the store manager for all reducers!

// To make a rootReducer we need to:

// 1. Get a method from redux, called combineReducers


import { combineReducers } from "redux";


// 2. Get each individual reducer


import frozenReducer from "./frozenReducer"; 


// We have now imported our (frozenReducer) function. We imported the default export of the frozenReducer.js file which is the frozenReducer function. 

// 3. Call combineReduers and hand it an object.

// Each key in combineReducers will be a piece of state in the redux store. 

// Each value will be the value of that piece of state, which is the reducer, and that reducer (function) will return a piece of state to the redux store. 

// We will make a constant (const) variable, we will call it rootReducer and we will assign it to the combineReducers() function that we imported from the redux module. We will hand it the

// combineReducers() function an object where we will have the key on the left and we will call it 'frozen' and on the right we will have the value to this key which is the frozenReducer

// function that we imported from the frozenReducer.js file. 


const rootReducer = combineReducers({

	frozen: frozenReducer

})


// This means that in our Redux Store we will have a little piece of state called "frozen" and the value of "frozen" is going to be whatever the frozenReducer function returns. 

// What does it return? Well, right now it is returning state and right now state is assigned to an empty array.

// This is how Redux works is that we will add another reducer for the "provider" will be another little piece of state inside of "redux". 

// In this way we can add as many features as we need and we can remove old ones, access any particular part of the Redux Store by grabbing the return value of a little piece of state or of

// a reducer.

// Lastly, we are going to export default the rootReducer,


rootReducer.js

// This is the rootReducer!! It is the store manager for all the reducers

// To make a rootReducer we need:

// 1. Get a method from redux called combineReducers


import { combineReducers } from "redux";


// 2. Get each individual reducer


import frozenReducer from "./frozenReducer";


// 3. Call combineReducers and hand it an object.

// Each key in combineReducers will be a piece of state in the redux store

// Each value in combineReducers will be the value of that piece of state in the redux store


const rootReducer = combineReducers ({

	frozen: frozenReducer

})


export default rootReducer; 


// Now, our rootReducer got created and we will go to the index.js file of the app, and then we will import the rootReducer.


index.js

import React from "react";

import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "./index.css";

import App from "./App";


// 1. In order to wire up a redux/react app we need react-redux. We need the Provider Component to be around everything.


import { Provider } from "react-redux";


// 2. Create the redux store, so that redux exists, and the Provider has a Store!


import { createStore } from "redux";


// 3. reducers to populate the store.

// 3a. We always start with a rootReducer.

// 4. Make individual reducers to hand to the rootReducer (3)


import rootReducer from "./reducers/rootReducers";


// 5. Create the store (2) by passing it the rootReducer, which is made up of all the reducers. 

// The rootReducer containing all the reducers is in the Store


const theStore = createStore(rootReducer);


// Provider is the glue between "react" and "redux". Give it the Store!

 
ReactDOM.render(

	<Provider store = {theStore}>

		<App />

	</Provider>

	document.getElementById("root")

);


// We can now go to the browser and we can see that we have succeeded in bootstrapping a Redux application. It does not do anything yet but we are on our way.
